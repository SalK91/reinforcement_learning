# Lectures on Reinforcement Learning
Welcome to *Lectures on Reinforcement Learning (RL)*, a structured set of lecture notes designed to build the mathematical foundations required to understand, analyze, and develop modern reinforcement learning methods.

These notes are inspired by and draw heavily on material from:
- Stanford CS234: Reinforcement Learning (Spring 2024)
- Stanford CS224R: Deep Reinforcement Learning (Spring 2025) 

The goal is not to reproduce these courses, but to synthesize their core ideas into a coherent, optimization- and mathematics-first perspective suitable for practitioners and researchers.
